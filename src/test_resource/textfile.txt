Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.[15][16][17] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.[18][19] The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.[20]

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[21]

Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a majority of systems. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller,[22] Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, allowing distribution of Python-based software for use on instances those environments without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter.
